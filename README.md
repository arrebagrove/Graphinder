# Localwire.Graphinder

Project intends to forge my current interest in solving optimization problems into something bigger, that will also allow me to try (and catch!) some new technologies I wanted to try out before while practicing a little more my design (patterns/architecture) skills along with some web development skills refresh from ASP.NET MVC stack.

Current roadmap:

1. Porting current solution with Simulated Annealing and Genetic alghoritms working on Minimal Vertex Cover problem from initial, console application to library.
2. Further decoupling for future IoC in ASP.NET MVC project.
3. Implementing missing unit tests for part of the code.
4. Parallelizing problem solving.
4. ASP.NET MVC base implementation for algorithms and problems.
5. Task queue implementation.
5. SignalR basic reporting back on progress on searching problem.
6. Front-end sugar.
