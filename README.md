# Localwire.Graphinder

Project intends to forge my current interest in solving optimization problems into something bigger, that will also allow me to try (and catch!) some new technologies I wanted to try out before while practicing a little more my design (patterns/architecture) skills along with some web development skills refresh from ASP.NET MVC stack.

### Current roadmap:

- [ ] Porting current solution with Simulated Annealing and Genetic alghoritms working on Minimal Vertex Cover problem from initial, console application to library.
- [ ] Further decoupling for future IoC in ASP.NET MVC project.
- [ ] Implementing missing unit tests for part of the code.
- [ ] Parallelizing problem solving.
- [ ] ASP.NET MVC base implementation for algorithms and problems.
- [ ] Task queue implementation.
- [ ] SignalR basic reporting back on progress on searching problem.
- [ ] Front-end sugar.
- [ ] Other problems and algorithms (perhaps)?
